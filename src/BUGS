fw is pretty unstable atm

1. strange screen tearing occurs occasionally when the graphical console scrolls
	seems to be some kinda heap related bug or stack overflow
	usually accompanied by the firmware crashing on reboot until the entire vm is hard reset (closed and opened again)
	this is super weird!

	temp fix: zero out first meg of RAM in llfw on crash til I have time to figure out whats goin on
